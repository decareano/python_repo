#what can I say...understanding the concept is one thing. it takes me two seconds. Implementing it is another issue alltogether.
#trick is to associate tallest person and first person....however, one needs to create a second sort ie: hg = sorted(heights, reverse=True)
#so that when you compare hg to heights the proper association is made....ie: Emma needs to come in before john in the list

def sortPeople(names, heights):
    heights.sort(reverse=True)
    result =[]
    
    for i in range(len(heights)):
        tallest_p = heights[i]
        #heights[i] = names
        #names = tallest_p
        result.append(names[i])
        #result.append(names[heights.index(i)])
    
    return result


    # temp = x
    # x = y
    # y = temp
    #result.append(names[heights.index(i)])
