# this exercise is over my head ATM. maybe later on....I understand the logic but the implementation is somewhat tricky

def reduceArray(nums):
    nums.sort()
    current = 0
    count = 0
    
    for i in nums:
        i -= current
        
        if i > 0:
            current = current + i
            count += 1
    return count

reduceArray([1,5,0,3,5])
